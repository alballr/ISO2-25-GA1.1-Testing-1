## Problem definition
The task consists of writing and testing a method that, given an object of type date, returns
whether it belongs to a leap year. If negative numbers or letters are passed, an exception
indicating this situation must be thrown. Consider the possibility of performing these checks at
the constructor level but use methods that ensure encapsulation. Furthermore, complete what
is necessary to include the following aspects:
- The user interface will be command-line based. Develop a component with classes and
specific methods to read integers, doubles, strings, and dates from the keyboard, and
to print strings and numbers to the screen.Use exceptions at those points in the program where it is necessary to control the
- program flow.
- Do not couple domain classes with the user interface (e.g., do not generate screen
output in domain logic classes).
